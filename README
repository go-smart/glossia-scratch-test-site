(Go-Smart) SIMULATION-MODEL-LARAVEL
===================================

This tool is the reference implementation of the Go-Smart domain model. It provides basic GSSA-XML generation, which is the input for the go-smart-simulation-server, from a simulation defined in the database.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

* MariaDB/MySQL
* Apache2/Nginx

INSTALLATION
------------

This is installed as a normal Laravel 4.2 app (http://laravel.com/docs/4.2). Once the appropriate permissions, database access settings, dependencies and Apache/Nginx files are configured you should run the following commands in the project root:
* php artisan migrate
* php artisan db:seed

You should now be able to access a few basic web pages:
* http://SERVER/protocols - shows a hyperlinked list of protocols

To retrieve GSSA-XML for a simulation, you must have a simulation defined in the database. The seeder will set up a couple and output GUIDs that you may use to retrieve them:
* http://SERVER/simulation/GUID - GSSA-XML for simulation GUID
* http://SERVER/simulation/GUID?html=1 - HTML rendering of the GSSA-XML for simulation GUID

You can retrieve a specific parameter from a combination (not including needle parameters) without defining a simulation by calling,
* http://SERVER/combination/GUID/parameter/PARAMETER_NAME
